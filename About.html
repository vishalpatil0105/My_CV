<h2> Q.Why i choose computer science.?</h2>
<hr>
<h2>From an early age Iâ€™ve always been deeply interested in computing.
    It was my mom, introducing me to the computer systems at her work place that first sparked this interest.
    I can always remember the feeling of wanting to know just how computers worked,
    why they worked and what else they could do...</h2>
